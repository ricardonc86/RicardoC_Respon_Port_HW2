# The Creation of Ricardo's Responsive Portfolio

The Purpose of this project is the creation of the developers portfolio. The target of this project is to create a site using CSS and Bootstrap elements to provide a responsive website that is adaptive to the users device screen. The device screen can range from it being a smartphone, pc or tablet, regardless of what screen the user is using the site will adjust instantly and give the user a visually pleasing, organized, readible website. 
By conducting this project I understand on why having a responsive website is important in the users experience and constructive to my skills in being a developer.
